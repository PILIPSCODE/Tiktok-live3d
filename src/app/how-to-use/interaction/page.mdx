Welcome to the interaction settings guide. Here, you'll learn how to configure both 3D and 2D interactions for your content.

    ## 3D Interaction Settings

    This section contains interaction settings specific to three-dimensional models and environments. 3D interactions often require different resources to create a truly immersive experience.

    ### Key Features

    - **`Set audio resource`**
      This feature allows you to attach an audio file to a 3D interaction. This is useful for creating immersive sound effects or background music that is triggered when a user interacts with an object.

    - **`Set Follow And Share`**
      Configures the 'Follow' and 'Share' functionality on a 3D element. This helps users follow content creators or share the interactive experience directly from the 3D scene.

    - **`Set Gift Interaction`**
      Defines the response that occurs when a user sends a virtual "Gift." This interaction can be a special visual effect, an animation, or even a sound that celebrates the gift.

    ## 2D Interaction Settings

    This section contains interaction settings for two-dimensional elements, such as images, GIFs, or text. 2D interactions are designed to be fast and lightweight.

    ### Key Features

    - **`Set audio and gif resource`**
      Unlike the 3D version, this feature allows you to attach **two** resources at once: an audio file and a GIF. This is ideal for adding fast visual animations and sound effects to 2D content.
      <a className="underline" href="/how-to-use/resource">Resource.</a>

    - **`Set Follow And Share`**
      Similar to the 3D version, this feature sets the 'Follow' and 'Share' functionality, but it is adapted for the 2D format.

    - **`Set Gift Interaction`**
      Determines the response to a virtual "Gift" on 2D content, such as the appearance of an animated sticker or a simple but eye-catching visual effect.
